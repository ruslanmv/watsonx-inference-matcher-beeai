### Sample Agent Request Document

This document outlines the requirements for generating a configuration agent.
It describes the purpose, constraints, and necessary parameters that must be handled
by the generated agent logic.

**Title:** Secure Web Server Configuration Agent

**Purpose:**
The goal is to create an intelligent agent capable of generating server configurations
that prioritize security, high throughput, and low latency.

**Functional Requirements:**
- The configuration must support TLS-based security protocols
- Ensure latency is capped at 50 milliseconds under normal load
- Handle up to 1000 HTTP REST API requests per second
- Support horizontal scalability
- Include authentication and rate-limiting

**Expected Output Format:**
- Python class or config dict with keys:
  - `handler_class`
  - `middlewares`
  - `rate_limit`
  - `authentication_scheme`

**User Parameters:**
- `parameter1`: TLS enabled (yes/no)
- `parameter2`: Version of the server core (e.g., v1, v2)
